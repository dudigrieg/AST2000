    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    place_spacecraft_on_escape_trajectory() places the spacecraft on an
    escape trajectory pointing directly away from the home planet.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rocket_thrust  :  float
        The total thrust of the rocket, in NEWTONS.

    rocket_mass_loss_rate  :  float
        The total mass loss rate of the rocket, in KILOGRAMS PER SECOND.

    time  :  float
        The time at which the spacecraft should be placed on the escape
        trajectory, in YEARS from the initial system time.

    height_above_surface  :  float
        The heigh above the home planet surface to place the spacecraft, in
        METERS (after launch).

    direction_angle  :  float
        The angle of the direction of motion of the spacecraft with respect
        to the x-axis, in DEGREES.

    remaining_fuel_mass  :  float
        The mass of fuel carried by the spacecraft after placing it on the
        escape trajectory, in KILOGRAMS.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        When none of the provided codes are valid for unlocking this method.
